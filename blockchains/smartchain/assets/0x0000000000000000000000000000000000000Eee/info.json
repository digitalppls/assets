It is the perfect app for those who have come to an event and want to socialize, for those who have moved to a new city and want to make friends quickly, and even just for finding an interesting conversation partner in a caf√© or restaurant.
MEEET can allow you to look for someone to chat with here and now, at any time, anywhere.
We firmly believe that offline communication and acquaintances are much more impactful than online ones.NFTs via P2P deals; participate in cool INOs; connecting Metaverses, games and marketplaces; maximize value and fun throughout the voyage.",
